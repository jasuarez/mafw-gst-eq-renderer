This is a fork of original mafw-gst-renderer that comes with MAFW package. It
adds a 10-band equalizer to the renderer.

Equalizer values for each band are stored in gconf (branch
/system/mafw/mafw-gst-eq-renderer/band<n>, where n=[0..9] corresponds to bands
29Hz, 59Hz, 119Hz, 227Hz, 474Hz, 947Hz, 1889Hz, 3770Hz, 7523Hz and 15011Hz,
respectively). Each value is the gain for that band, being between -24dB and
+12dB.

To set equalizer, one must change the value in gconf; the renderer will react
inmediately and update the corresponding value in gstreamer's equalizer.

In case the application client does not provide a utility to change the
equalizer, a Control Panel applet is provided too, that shows a graphical
equalizer that user can use to set the equalizer. This applet allows also to
save, load and delete presets.

Building this plugin will generate a package called 'mafw-gst-eq-renderer'. The
obtained plugin is named 'Mafw-Gst-Renderer-Plugin', the source is
'Mafw-Gst-Renderer' and  the UUID for this renderer is 'gstrenderer'.




How to install
==============

As this plugin provides the same functionality as mafw-gst-renderer, it is
intended to replace it. Moreover, it should replace it, as it uses the same
plugin name, source name and UUID.

The suggested steps are the following ones:

1) Install the package
2) Remove mafw-gst-renderer

If you are still unable to play a song, then mafw-gst-eq-renderer plugin must
be restarted. This can be done rebooting the device, or stoping/starting the
plugin from a terminal:

  $ mafw.sh stop mafw-gst-eq-renderer
  $ sudo mafw.sh start mafw-gst-eq-renderer -7
